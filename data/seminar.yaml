      What if the future of software architecture doesn’t need architects as we
      know them? As GenAI infiltrates every stage of the software development
      lifecycle, the traditional role of the architect—meticulously designing
      systems from requirements to deployment—is being unbundled, redefined,
      and partially outsourced to machines. And yet, the industry is far from
      ready. This keynote presents a bold vision of the AI-Augmented Architect:
      a hybrid thinker who doesn’t write blueprints alone but designs with AI,
      using it not as a tool—but as a creative partner, a challenger, a
      simulator of trade-offs. Drawing from two cutting-edge empirical studies,
      including a multivocal review of GenAI in software architecture and a
      forward-looking survey of industry leaders, we’ll confront hard truths: AI
      is already doing architectural documentation, detecting antipatterns, and
      even suggesting design alternatives. But it’s also hallucinating, biasing
      decisions, and eroding accountability. If we don’t rethink our roles,
      methods, and mindset, software architects risk becoming passive validators
      of AI output rather than strategic designers of complex systems. The good
      news? There is still time to adapt—but only if we embrace a future where
      architecture is not less human, but more profoundly human because of our
      collaboration with machines.

      Rust is a modern language that guarantees memory-safety while supporting
      low-level concepts similar to C and C++. Particularly, it has a built-in
      feature-expression language and allows for configuring the usage of Rust
      crates (libraries) used in other Rust projects. Yet the variability in the
      Rust ecosystem remains largely undiscovered leaving developers confronted
      with several issues such as including too many unnecessary features,
      feature versioning, and possible feature interactions. In our talk, we
      demonstrate how to analyze the variability inherent in single Rust crates.
      We show how a feature model can be synthesized by different Rust
      configurations (selection of features of a used Rust library in another
      Rust project) using an FCA based method. We analyze the resulting feature
      models to understand the size of the configuration space and the usage of
      features among Rust libraries.

      Quantum computing improves substantially on known classical algorithms for
      various important problems, but the nature of the relationship between
      quantum and classical computing is not yet fully understood. This
      relationship can be clarified by free models, that add to classical
      computing just enough physical principles to represent quantum computing
      and no more. In this talk, I will describe an axiomatisation of quantum
      computing that replaces the standard continuous postulates with a small
      number of discrete equations, as well as a free model that replaces the
      standard linear-algebraic model with a category-theoretical one. The
      axioms and model are based on reversible classical computing, isolate
      quantum advantage in the ability to take certain well-behaved square
      roots, and link to various quantum computing hardware platforms. This
      approach allows combinatorial optimisation, including brute force computer
      search, to optimise quantum computations. The free model may be
      interpreted as a programming language for quantum computers, that has the
      same expressivity and computational universality as the standard model,
      but additionally allows automated verification and reasoning.

      The world relies on distributed systems, but distributed systems can be
      unreliable. Crashes, hangs, and data corruption happen in even the most
      battle-tested systems, all because some programmer didn't think "event B"
      would ever happen before "event A". Most distributed systems have too many
      event orderings to consider them all, making some bugs appear impossible
      to prevent---and as systems become more distributed and more of our code
      is written by mercurial LLMs, these bugs are becoming more of a problem.
      In this talk, I'll show how programming language research is giving us the
      tools to build faster, safer, and simpler distributed systems. We'll
      explore some of the elegant mathematics behind these tools and wrap up
      with a few fun ideas on the horizon.

    title: Towards a Higher-Order Bialgebraic Denotational Semantics
    abstract: |-
      The bialgebraic abstract GSOS framework by Turi and Plotkin provides an
      elegant categorical approach to modelling the operational and denotational
      semantics of programming and process languages. In abstract GSOS,
      bisimilarity is always a congruence, and it coincides with denotational
      equivalence. This saves the language designer from intricate, ad-hoc
      reasoning to establish these properties. The bialgebraic perspective
      on operational semantics in the style of abstract GSOS has recently been
      extended to higher-order languages, preserving compositionality of
      bisimilarity. However, a categorical understanding of bialgebraic
      denotational semantics according to Turi and Plotkin’s original vision has
      so far been missing in the higher-order setting. In the present paper, we
      develop a theory of adequate denotational semantics in higher-order
      abstract GSOS. The denotational models are parametric in an appropriately
      chosen semantic domain in the form of a locally final coalgebra for a
      behaviour bifunctor, whose construction is fully decoupled from the syntax
      of the language. Our approach captures existing accounts of denotational
      semantics such as semantic domains built via general step-indexing,
      previously introduced on a per-language basis, and is shown to be
      applicable to a wide range of different higher-order languages, e.g.
      simply typed and untyped languages, or languages with computational
      effects such as probabilistic or non-deterministic branching.
